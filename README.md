We have chosen to make a polynomial regression model using LinearRegressor.
The problem most certainly fit a regression model rather than a classification model, as we are working with continuous numerical data,
and we want the output of our model to be a numerical value (the closing stock price on a given day), rather than a category (for example 'Low price' and 'High price').
